# Singularity Hub Paper

This is the code for the Singularity Hub paper. You should be able to view the comparison tree at [result/index.html](result/index.html).
Note that the version of Singularity Python used for this is older than currently on master,
you will need to install:

```bash
git clone -b v2.5 https://www.github.com/singularityhub/singularity-python.git
cd singularity-python
python setup.py install
```

And the images used were also Singularity version 2.2 and 2.3.

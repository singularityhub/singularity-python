# Singularity Python

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/singularityware/singularity-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/singularityware/singularity-python)

Singularity Python is a python module and command line tool to provide helpers for working with <a href="https://singularityware.github.io" target="_blank">Singularity</a> containers, specifically providing functions to visualize, package, and compare containers. 

 - If you are looking for the Singularity Python client to pull, build, and otherwise wrap Singularity functions, then please see the repository [singularity-cli](https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-cli) for the [spython](https://pypi.org/project/spython/) module.
 - If you are looking for local management and interaction with various storage locations (e.g., to pull and inspect containers in Singularity Hub, Registry, or other cloud resource) then please see the [Global Client](https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry-cli) for the `sregistry` module.

## Install
You have the option to install only the dependencies that are needed for your functionality of interest.

```bash
# All
pip install singularity

# Metrics and analysis dependencies
pip install singularity[metrics]

# Building on Google Cloud
pip install singularity[google[
```


We currently require Python > version 3 to use various timezone functions. If you are unable to install version 3.0, we provide a [Singularity.container](Singularity.container) for you to use instead. This is the recommended approach as some older versions of Python do not support generation of the timestamp. See the [installation docs](https://github.com/singularityware/singularity-python/wiki/Installation) for your different options.

The Singularity-Python code is licensed under the MIT open source license, which is a highly permissive license that places few limits upon reuse. This ensures that the code will be usable by the greatest number of researchers, in both academia and industry. The following examples are provided:
